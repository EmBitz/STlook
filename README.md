# STlook: A Look-Alike STLink Firmware

This repository hosts the ongoing development of **STlook**, a look-alike STLink firmware.  

The project will begin with the **USB Full-Speed (FS, V2)** version on its original platform, **STM32F1**, followed by adding the **USB High-Speed (HS, V3)** version on **STM32F7**.

### Why a "software clone"?

Beyond being fun to develop, a **software clone** is useful because it provides full control over the probe's firmware. This allows the project to be **ported to other MCUs and manufacturers**, and enables the addition of **features and enhancements** that are not available in the original software.  

This project is primarily for **educational fun**, but it also aims to deliver a **truly useful result**.
