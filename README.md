# STlook a Look-Alike STLink Firmware

This repository hosts the ongoing development of a **look-alike STLink firmware**.  

The project will start with **USB Full-Speed (FS)** on its original platform, **STM32F1**, followed by **USB High-Speed (HS)** on the **STM32F7**.  

In the future, additional platforms for other MCUs will be added as the project evolves.  

This project is primarily for **educational fun**, but it also aims to deliver a **truly useful result**.
