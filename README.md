# STlook a Look-Alike STLink Firmware

This repository hosts the ongoing development of a **look-alike STLink firmware**.  

The project will start with **USB Full-Speed (FS)** on its original platform, **STM32F1**, followed by **USB High-Speed (HS)** on the **STM32F7**.  

This project is primarily for **educational fun**, but it also aims to deliver a **truly useful result**.

### Why a "software clone"?

Besides being fun to develop, having a **software clone** is useful because it gives full control over the probe's firmware. This allows the project to be **ported to other MCUs and manufacturers**, and also enables the addition of **features and enhancements** that are not available in the original software.
